<p class="meta">1 April 2023 - Austin</p>

I have finally set up my personal blog on github! :)
I have used several blogging services so far, but was frustrated with how they are discontinued, changing UI, adding ads, etc. 
So I have been meaning to start a blog on github, where I will have more control.
I am excited to have finally made the move! I will add contents slowly, and potentially move posts from my older blogs hosted at WordPress. 

### P.S.
It's funny that I decided to do this, out of all days, on April Fool's day!
